## X-GEN POS

`Description`

An endeavor to implement SOLID principles in a more useful application that I could also profit from. The design was carefully crafted to make it very user-friendly to its users compared to other POS software. It is still in development mode, but lots of its features in the Master branch are working accordingly. The SOLID principle was implemented on the Main (NodeJS) side of the project as I just used the common principles for the Front-end. The struggles I have gone through in this project were the keys to my growth. I also used some of the ideas I have learned in building REST API to the Main side, as I saw that it fits well with the project.
